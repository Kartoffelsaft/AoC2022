These are my programs for the Advent of Code 2022. I'm doing this one in Zig as a challenge for myself, so to build and run you'll need all the zig compiler.

## Usage

Put a day's input into a file in the project root named `day#Input`, where `#` is the day of the month. This file isn't in the repository as it is different from person to person.

Then it should be as simple as:

```bash
zig build
./zig-out/bin/aoc2022 #
```

Again, where `#` is the problem's day.
